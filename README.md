Carly has the most popular costume shop in town and generates a lot of sales throughout the year. She has downloaded her 4th quarter sales and needs the data available in Excel so she can analyze her sales. Doing so will help her better manage her inventory throughout the year and during peak seasons, such as Halloween. She has asked you, her intern, for assistance in creating formulas that will help her understand the supply and demand of her costumes. The categories listed in the workbook are the top-selling categories. The shop carries over 500 types of costumes.

## Project 5

### Description
The company is considering branching into the online retail market soon because of the global pandemic. Your supervisor, Kayla Zimmerman, wants to review last year’s sales data and make predictions about this year’s sales data before making any decisions on whether or not to begin selling online and, if so, which products may sell well online. You have been asked to determine the best-selling women’s and men’s clothing line by ranking them on a scale from A to E. Only products that have a ranking of A or B will be considered for online sales. To branch into the online market in the future, next year’s total sales must be at least $3,000,000. Finally, if B-Trendz, Inc. begins selling products online, you will need help setting up and maintaining the online store. Several companies have given you their information, and you need to determine which company would best fit the needs for the B-Trendz online website.
